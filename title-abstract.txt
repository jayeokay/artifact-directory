Title:
Real-Network Modeling

Abstract:
The internet was introduced back in 1983 but it wasnâ€™t until 1994 that a company known as NetMarket first started selling internet services. Since then, the satellite service providing industry has increased exponentially. Every company aims to provide the best network conditions to customers in an industry where quality is so important. And that is specifically where improvements can always be made. Being able to detect network issues and monitor network performance for issues is so important in the real world for positive customer experience and that is the problem we home to tackle with our project. Predicting latency and packet loss can be extremely beneficial from a network providers perspective as they aim to give out the best service possible. This information is vital in the monitoring of network conditions to ensure the quality of the product. We predicted these issues based on machine learning models in attempt to improve the internet experience for customers.
